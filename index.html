                    The brand’s first advertisement appeared in May 1886, shortly after Coca‑Cola was invented by Dr. John S. Pemberton. Published in an Atlanta newspaper, the ad described the drink as a “Delicious and Refreshing Beverage.” It marked the beginning of Coca‑Cola’s iconic advertising journey. The name and distinctive script logo were created by Pemberton’s bookkeeper, Frank M. Robinson. This modest newspaper ad was the first step in building what would become one of the most recognizable and enduring brands in the world.

                    In 1931, Coca‑Cola asked artist Haddon Sundblom to draw Santa Claus for their Christmas ads. He was inspired by the poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas” and showed Santa as happy, kind, and dressed in red and white—just like Coca‑Cola’s colors. These ads ran every year and helped people around the world picture Santa the way we see him today. Coca‑Cola didn’t invent Santa, but their ads made this version of him super popular.

                <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                    "Thanda Matlab Coca-Cola" was an iconic early 2000s ad campaign in India that cleverly equated the word "thanda" (cold drink) with Coca-Cola itself. Featuring Aamir Khan in various regional avatars, the campaign used local humor and cultural nuances to connect with rural and semi-urban audiences. Its catchy slogan and relatable storytelling made Coca-Cola a household name and redefined how Indians referred to soft drinks, turning a generic term into brand recall.

It encouraged consumers to find and share happiness in their everyday lives, often depicted through vibrant visuals of people connecting and celebrating with a Coca-Cola in hand.
